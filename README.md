# Neural Network from Scratch

This is a basic library for creating neural networks. This implementation is largely based on the tutorial, [Neural Network from scratch in Python](https://towardsdatascience.com/math-neural-network-from-scratch-in-python-d6da9f29ce65) by [Omar Aflak](https://github.com/omaraflak)

## Additions to the functionality of tutorial:
- The classic sigmoid and ReLU activation functions
- Binary cross entropy as a loss function
- Mini-batches
